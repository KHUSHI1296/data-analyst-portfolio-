# Chinook SQL Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates my SQL skills using the Chinook database, a sample music store database commonly used for data analysis practice.

The project focuses on real-world SQL queries used in Data Analyst roles, including filtering, joins, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.



## Dataset
Chinook Database (Music Store)
Tables used:
- Customer
- Invoice
- InvoiceLine
- Track
- Album
- Artist



## Skills Demonstrated
- SQL filtering and aggregation
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- Subqueries
- Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

## Key Business Questions Answered
- Which customers generate the highest revenue?
- Which countries have the most customers?
- Who are the top customers compared to average spending?
- How does revenue rank across customers?
- How can complex queries be simplified using CTEs?
