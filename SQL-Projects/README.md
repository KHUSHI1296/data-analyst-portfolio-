# Chinook SQL Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates my SQL skills using the Chinook database, a sample music store database commonly used for data analysis practice.

The project focuses on real-world SQL queries used in Data Analyst roles, including filtering, joins, subqueries, window functions, and CTEs.
